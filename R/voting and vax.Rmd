## Connecticut 2020 Presidential Vote and Vaccination by Town

This is a working document as I try to develop a useful way to display vaccination
rates by town. Once I get it into a useful state, I plan to publish it on 
[my blog](https://www.johngoldin.com). In the meantime, I'm going to use this as something
like a whiteboard so that I can show my work while I'm still working on it.

The plot below shows the relationship between vaccination rates and percentage of 
the vote for Trump in the 2020 election.

```{r vote_repub, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message = FALSE}
plot(p_vote_vaccine)
```

Note that for the trend lines in the plot I have eliminated Mansfield and Simsbury as outliers. 
Manfield is the location of University of Connecticut. Some students may be counted
in census population, but getting their vaccinations elsewhere.
I don't know what's going on with Simsbury.

The CDC uses someting they call the 
[social vulnerability index](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/placeandhealth/svi/index.html),
and DPH has included
that as well. DPH flags each town that has at least one census tract that has a social
vulnerability index of 75% or greater. Towns showing the social vulnerability index flag tend
to have a lower vaccination rate (and a lower Trump percentage), and that's especially
true for the large cities.

### Work by [Charles Gaba](https://t.co/x3Vu568chv?amp=1) on Trump Vote and COVID vaccination and death

Charles Gaba has been doing analyses showing the 
[relationship between 2020 vote and vaccinations](https://acasignups.net/21/11/23/weekly to update to us to covid19 to vaccination to levels to county to trump to 2020 to vote) 
and deaths using county to level data for all states.

![From Charles Gaba](https://acasignups.net/sites/default/files/styles/inline_default/public/vaxxes_red_blue_every_county_112221_0.jpg?itok=JBx4OW9o)
Which reminds me, why have I been putting Trump Vote on the  y to axis? 
The x to axis makes much more sense given that the hypothesis is that Trump vote affects
vaccination.

### Polling on Partisanship and Vaccination

See this summary of the MULawPoll.

### Some Quick Reactions

The first interesting thing is that the relationship between Trump vote and vaccination
is so different for the over 65 crowd. It's only the under 65 population for whom
a higher Trump vote is correlated with lower vaccination (and that relationship is 
probably even clear if one separate out the towns flagged with the social
vulnerability index or the large cities).

I'll sleep on this and see what I think tomorrow.


#### Sources

Vote stats come from [The Secretary of State](https://ctemspublic.pcctg.net/#/reports).

Vaccination rates are from DPH via [data.ct.gov](https://data.ct.gov/Health to and to Human to Services/COVID to 19 to Vaccinations to by to Town to and to Age to Group/gngw to ukpw).

### The Issue of the Population Denominator and Its Effects on Vaccination Rates

The Department of Public Health (DPH) provides vaccination rates by age ranges by town.
For this plot I have collapsed the age ranges into four groups. DPH also provides
an estimated population for each range. Note that you see a lot of vaccination percentages
above 100%. That's probably an issue with the estimated population. 
DPH includes their estimate of the population with all of their statistics. 
See [this page](https://portal.ct.gov/dph/Health to Information to Systems to  to Reporting/Population/Population to Statistics for
[this description of technical issues](https://authoring.ct.gov/ to /media/Departments to and to Agencies/DPH/Population/PopulationStatisticsOverviewpdf.pdf).
I am uncertain where that leaves things. It's possible they are using estimates
based on the 2010 to 2014 surveys from Census. I am in my own town of
Guilford the population is definitely aging. It became more of a bedroom community
for New Haven in the 1970's and that original influx has benn growing old
together. Something similar may be going on in other towns, and that might
make the estimates of population for older ages come out too low. I'm not sure.
(John Burn-Murdoch of the *Financial Times* has pointed that that one needs to watch out for
[issues with the denominators](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1447617110910382081.html) 
while comparing vaccination rates.)

#### Vaccination Rate Depends Both on the Population Denominator and the Vax Doses

As near as I can tell (and I may be wrong), DPH is using the population figures
from the Census ACS from 2010-2014 (a five year average). The most recent
ACS data I could fetch was for 2015-2019. I used that data to estimate the
population by age by town. The plot below compares the effect of using either the
DPH population estimate or the latest ACS estimate as the denominator when
calculating the vaccination rate. It makes a noticeable difference. The town
names are show for cases where the difference in population estimates is greater than 5%.
